        <p id="summary">These are the Harle girls, or also better known as the Harle's "Angels".
            Honestly though they really are the most wonderful girls you will meet. Each one of them with their own
            amazing qualities, ranging from compasion for one another, to just out right goofey!
            Though don't get me wrong, they all have their moments and their disagreements but that's 
            not what this is about. Here we are going to talk about the oldest Piper, a 9
            year old, who dispite her age she is quite mature, look out mom and dad she isn't a teenager
            yet! Then we have Payton, an 8 year old, and let me just tell you she is a real fire cracker!
            For now let's move on to Presley, a 7 year old, who has been a true goof ball from day one!
            Now last but certainly not least, we have Paxtyn, a 3 year old, who is just little
            Miss Independant! This is only a small introduction for each of these outstanding girls.
            Please visit each of their pages to learn more about what makes them all so special!
