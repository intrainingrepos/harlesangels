    <p id="summary"> Let me introduce you to Miss Piper Harle! She is the oldest 
        of the Harle girls, but you wouldn't need me to tell you that if you only 
        met her. Piper is a beautiful, respectful and a very mature young lady. I've 
        never met such a smart and passionate girl before. Always wanting to know 
        the facts, always ready to sit down and have an indepth conversation. Piper
        is a real math wiz and problem solver. Her safistication and intelligence aren't 
        the only qualities that will surprise you about her. Piper is also very sweet, 
        caring, and be prepared to crack up because she will always be making you laugh! 
        In her spare time, you will often find her nose deep in a good book, up in her private 
        tree house or having fun with her three younger sisters!
