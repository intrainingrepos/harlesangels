    <p id="summary"> Here we have our lovely young lady, Miss Presley Harle! Presley is 
        above all one of the biggest and funniest goof balls I, and you will ever meet! 
        She is always trying to make you laugh and lighten any mood with her humorous antics!
        Always thinking of others, trying to do what she can to help, you could definitely
        say that Presley is a kind-hearted and compassionate girl. When she isn't trying to make
        you laugh, she is outside having fun and playing with her sisters. She loves riding her bike, playing on her 
        playgound, and hiding out in her tree house. Though when she isn't out having fun and exploring,
        she is sunk into a fun filled fairytale book or studying up with her sisters, absorbing new
        information.
